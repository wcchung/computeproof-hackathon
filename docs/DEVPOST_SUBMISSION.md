## üéØ Inspiration

GPU compute marketplaces and AI training workflows suffer from a critical trust gap. How do you prove:
- That a job actually ran for 4.2 GPU hours, not 4.0?
- Which specific resources produced which AI model?
- That billing disputes have transparent, verifiable evidence?

With AI compute costs reaching thousands of dollars per training run, and distributed GPU marketplaces growing rapidly, we need **immutable receipts** for every compute job. Current systems rely on centralized logs that can be manipulated or disputed.

ComputeProof solves this by creating a **verifiable audit trail** using Numbers Protocol's ERC-7053 commits on blockchain, where every GPU job state is permanently recorded and independently verifiable.

## üí° What it does

ComputeProof records the complete lifecycle of GPU compute jobs as verifiable on-chain receipts:

1. **Job Submission** ‚Üí Creates a unique NID with GPU requirements and job config
2. **Job Scheduling** ‚Üí Records which node received the job
3. **Job Execution** ‚Üí Logs start time, container ID, and GPU allocation
4. **Progress Updates** ‚Üí Optional checkpoints during long-running jobs
5. **Job Completion** ‚Üí Records output artifacts, metrics, and actual resource usage
6. **Job Failure** ‚Üí Captures error details for debugging

Each event is committed to Numbers Mainnet as an ERC-7053 commit, creating a transparent, tamper-proof timeline. Compute providers, users, and auditors can verify the complete history at any time.

**Key Innovation:** Unlike traditional logging systems, ComputeProof provides **cryptographically verifiable receipts** that no single party can manipulate, perfect for billing disputes and compliance auditing.

## üèóÔ∏è How we built it

**Architecture:**
- **Backend API:** Node.js + Express handling job lifecycle events
- **Capture SDK Integration:** Asset registration and commit operations
- **Numbers Mainnet:** ERC-7053 commits for all state transitions
- **Audit Dashboard:** React + TailwindCSS with real-time metrics
- **Storage:** IPFS via Capture API for job configs and outputs

**Technical Flow:**
1. Job submitted via API ‚Üí Registered as asset on Numbers Protocol
2. State transitions (schedule, start, progress, complete) ‚Üí Each commits to blockchain
3. Dashboard queries asset history ‚Üí Renders chronological timeline
4. Metrics calculated from on-chain data ‚Üí GPU hours, costs, efficiency
5. All transactions verifiable on Numbers Mainnet explorer

**Implementation Highlights:**
- Event schema supporting 6 different job states
- Idempotency handling to prevent duplicate commits
- Selective disclosure for sensitive job configurations
- Metrics aggregation from distributed blockchain events
- Real-time dashboard with job filtering and search

## üß© Challenges we ran into

1. **State Machine Complexity:** Designing a flexible event schema that handles success, failure, and retry scenarios while keeping gas costs reasonable.

2. **Privacy vs. Transparency:** GPU job configs often contain proprietary information (docker images, datasets). We implemented selective disclosure using hash commitments‚Äîpublic metadata visible on-chain, sensitive data hashed.

3. **Metrics Calculation:** Computing accurate GPU hours and costs from blockchain timestamps required careful handling of time zones and potential clock drift between nodes.

4. **Ordering Guarantees:** Blockchain confirmations can arrive out-of-order. We implemented both on-chain ordering (block number) and application-level ordering (custom timestamps) for correct timeline display.

5. **Testing Without Real GPUs:** Simulating realistic GPU job workflows without actual Kubernetes/Slurm infrastructure. We created a comprehensive test script that mimics real job state transitions.

## üéì What we learned

- **ERC-7053 for Compute Workflows:** Adapting a digital media standard to track computational processes‚Äîan unexpected but powerful use case.

- **Blockchain as Audit Log:** Understanding when blockchain provides value over traditional databases (tamper-proof records vs. query performance).

- **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Balancing the cost of on-chain commits against the value of immutable receipts. For expensive GPU jobs ($100+/hour), commit costs ($0.01) are negligible.

- **Numbers Protocol Ecosystem:** Deep understanding of Capture SDK workflows, parent-child asset relationships, and asset history queries.

- **Real-World Applicability:** GPU marketplaces like Render Network and Akash could benefit immediately from this verification layer. The AI training market alone is projected to exceed $100B by 2030.

## üöÄ What's next for ComputeProof

**Immediate Integrations:**
- Kubernetes sidecar container for automatic event logging
- Slurm adapter for HPC environment integration
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD GPU job tracking
- CLI tool for developers (`computeproof submit job.yaml`)

**Platform Expansion:**
- Integration with GPU marketplaces (Render, Akash, Vast.ai)
- Support for multi-cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Azure GPU instances)
- Carbon footprint calculation from verified GPU hours
- Smart contract automation for milestone-based payments

**Advanced Features:**
- ML model provenance linking (which compute ‚Üí which model)
- Anomaly detection for suspicious resource usage
- Cost optimization recommendations based on historical data
- Insurance products backed by verifiable compute records

**Enterprise Use Cases:**
- **Research Institutions:** Grant reporting with verified compute usage
- **AI Companies:** Regulatory compliance for model training logs
- **Cloud Providers:** Dispute resolution with immutable evidence
- **Carbon Markets:** GPU carbon offset programs with verified data

ComputeProof demonstrates how Numbers Protocol can bring trust and transparency to any resource-intensive computational process, not just digital media.

## üìå IMAGES TO UPLOAD

You need 3-5 screenshots showing:

1. **Dashboard Overview** (Cover Image - Most Important!)
   - Show job list with stats (GPU hours, costs, status)
   
2. **Job Detail View**
   - Display complete event timeline for a single job
   
3. **Event Detail**
   - Show specific commit with transaction hash and metrics
   
4. **Asset Profile on Numbers**
   - Screenshot from verify.numbersprotocol.io
   
5. **Transaction on Block Explorer**

**Screenshot Tips:**
- Use dark theme (looks more professional for GPU/tech)
- Show real job data, not placeholders
- Include visible transaction hashes
- Make metrics prominent (GPU hours, costs)
